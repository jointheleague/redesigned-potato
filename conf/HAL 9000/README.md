# Tic-Tac-Toe-ML

A platform for machine learning based around the simple game of tic-tac-toe, our project allows you to train, test, and play against many differing AI implementations. Even develop your own if that's what you fancy!

## Installation

To install and build on your desktop device, simply clone our project on github!
At this point in time, all libraries, such as our rendering library, are included in the "/lib" directory. 

*Note : You may need to add ```awtutils.jar```, located in the "/lib" directory to your Java Build Path in your prefered IDE before running.*


## Developing Your Own Custom AI
To develop your own custom AI for the TTTML framework, you will need to complete four steps :
<ul>
<li> Define a Base Implementation
<li> Create an Implementation of the AI Interface
<li> Write your own Simulation Controller
<li> Package your code for deployment
</ul>


*Let's get started...*


### The Base Implementation


The Base Implementation is essentially the core of how your AI works. For example : one possible base implementation is the Neural Network Implementation. Another might be a Decision Tree Implementation. Think of the base implementation as a bunch of utility classes that are needed for your AI to work...


Because most Base Implementations will be large and span over more than one file, you can store your base implementation classes and other files under the package ``` com.ttt.ai.yourAIname ```.


Other than that, your base implementation can work however you want. If your AI is really small, such as just a random guesser, you may not have an base implementation at all. The base implementation is simply a clean place for you to store classes and other files needed for your AI to work! Next we will learn how to interface between your base implementation and the game board by writing an implementation for the AI class.


### The AI Implementation


The AI implementation interfaces between your custom base implementation, and the game board. To start, create a class and implement the ```AI``` interface. This will give you one method, titled, ```getNextMove```


This method will be called every time it is your AI's turn to make a move on the game board.


Here is it's definition : ```TilePosition getNextMove(Tile[][] tiles)```


You are given a 2D array of type ```Tile```, which is an enum. The Three possible tile types are :




 ```Tile.EMPTY```, ```Tile.X```, and ```Tile.O```
 
 From that information, use classes in your base implementation to determine the next move, 
and return it as a ```Tile Position```.
 
 *For Example,* ```return new TilePosition(Tile.X, 2, 1);```
 
 Once you've filled out the body for the ```getNextMove``` method, you're all done with the AI implementation!

 
### The Simulation Controller

 
 Your simulation controller will be run before humans start to play against your AI. Use it to have your AI learn and become more "smart." Simulation Controllers will manage the simulation of multiple games while your AI is in the "learning" phase.
 
 Much like the previous two steps, there are few strict rules about how you go about running your simulation, however your simulation controller class must ```extend SimulationController```, to be compatible with the framework...
 
 The last thing you need to do to finish the Simulation Controller is to override and fill in the body of the method ```simulate()```, which is inherited from the superclass, ```SimulationController```.
 
 The simulation controller can work however you like, however, it must return the finished ```Player``` object when it's done. This finished ```Player``` will be used to play against a human.
 
 *Here are a few things you may need to know whilst writing your simulation controller...*
 
 Define a new ```Player``` by executing ```Player myPlayer = new AIPlayer(String label)```, you can then set it's AI Implementation with ```myPlayer.setNetwork(AI net)```. You should pass in your custom AI implementation as the "net" variable.
 
 *Remember : Your AI Implementation interfaces directly with your base implementation, so no need to tell the player object which base implementation you are going to use!*
 
 To start a new game, use ```new GameController(Player a, Player b)```, which will return the winner as an object of the type ```Player```. 
 
  *Remember : When finished with the simulation, return the Player object that you want to play against humans on the live game board!*

### Packaging And Deploying

At this point you should have all the implementation done for your AI. Now itâ€™s time to get it ready for deployment!

Start by creating a folder for your finished deployable package, which should share the name of your AI.

Place that folder under the already existing ```/conf``` folder so that you can test your code as a built package locally before you publish it for other users.

Once you have your folder under the ```/conf``` folder, it's time to add a ```.cfg``` file that will tell the AI loader how to load your AI. 

Start by creating a ```.cfg``` file in the folder you just created. The name of your ```.cfg``` file should be the name of your AI. Your ```.cfg``` file should contain two things : 

<ul>
<li> A name for your AI
<li> The classpath to your simulation controller 
</ul>

In the end, a sample ```/conf/MyAI/MyAI.cfg``` file should read as follows : 

```Name MyAI ```
<br>
```Class com.ttt.ai.myAI.mySimController```

Now that we have a config setup, we simply need to package our implementation!

First, copy all your ```.java``` files into the ```/conf/YourAIName/``` folder, and remove their package declerations. A list of all the files that should be included goes as follows : 
<ul>
<li>All Base Implementation .java files
<li>Your AI Implementation .java file
<li>Your Simulation Controller .java file
</ul>

Once you ensure that all the files listed above are included, and their package declerations are removed, you can start to test!

If you see your AI name in the dropdown menus, and it works at runtime how you intended, it's finally time to deploy!

Simply zip the __contents__ of your AI's root folder (the one you created under ```/conf```), and send that ```.zip``` to whoever wants your AI. 

You're all set!
Good Luck, Have Fun!
